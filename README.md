Recipe for pizza-
Ingredients
1 c. pizza sauce
8 oz. provolone cheese, thinly sliced
2 c. shredded low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese
6 tbsp. grated parmesan cheese

After you've made the dough, divide it in half and let come to room temperature, uncovered, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet on the oven floor and preheat to 500Ëš.
On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out 1 piece of dough into a 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Dust a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet with cornmeal and lay the dough on top.
Spread half of the sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Top with half of the provolone, then with half each of the mozzarella and parmesan.
Slide the pizza onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings. Makes 2 12-inch pizzas.
